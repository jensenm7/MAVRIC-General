Christa - head engineer 

## What is protocase

Ultra lean manufacturing
One stop shop
This is the work that no one in the industry wanted
Fast (2-3 days)

## Why sponsor URC

Intro to next level manufacturing.
More time and energy for teams.
$2000 for free, and 50% off anything beyound that.
This does not count towards the URC budget.
Beyound 2k does.

### Students shouldn't be used for cheap labor.

## What is protocase offering

Custom electronic enclosures and sheet metal parts.
CNC machining.
Misc.

### Tools available

* Laser cutting
* 3 & 5 axis cnc
* Cnc lathe
* DeburrOC sanding
* Press brake or folder
* Welding 
* Powerdercoating
* Silkscreening or digital printing
* Self clinching fasteners (PEMs)
* Other secondary machining
* Assembly, inspections, and packaging

## Process of acquiring fabricated parts

1. Attend the webinar
2. Utilize the rover design tips PDF
3. Contart info@protocase.com to connect with account manager
4. Once design is ready, send to account manager to get quote
5. Design optimization help
	a. ASK QUESTIONS AND OPTIMIZE
6. Approve via E-Drawing for final draft
7. Shipping is included
8. Recieve a pro forma invoice 
9. Your account manager is your contact point with protocase

## Maximize your budget

Stay within stocked parts and materials.
Do sheet metal whenever possible.
Some CNC can be done after sheet metal work.

## Making things run smoothly

Understandable tolerances. Listed on their website.

http://www.protocase.com/resources/fabrication-tolerances.php 

Get your model correct.
Get at it and do it asap.
The more testing and iterations, the better. 
Do not use Protocase to bail you out of procrastination
Allow for 2-3 days manufacturing.
Allow 2 buisness days for shipping.
Allow 24-48 hours for drawing approval.

## Failure logging

Will be included in this years competition.
Any and all failures will be logged, described, and cause listed.
All teams data will be available after competition to all contestants.

> Fools learn from their own mistakes
> Smart people learn from others mistakes

_*TESTING MUST BE DONE BEFORE COMPETITION!!!*_

Goal: Reduce failure rates.

To reduce failures by 50% get rid of
* Loose connectors
* Riped out wires
* Fasteners coming loose

## CAD Options

Solidworks
INCHES
PDF for graphics

Many other options, additional fees if not used. 

### Tolerances

.005 for cut outs and profile.
.010 for bend radius.
1 degree bend angle.
.010 clearance between mating parts.

.020 to circuit boards from inside face of 
over size cutouts by .010~.020

Powedercoat will add .003 nominal.

Sheet metal radii defined by inside radius.
Table with all possible radii will be provided.

## Solidworks CAD option

DO NOT USE 3RD FLANGE POSITION OPTION.

## Design for manufacturability

Do not dimension to the bend radius line. 
Dimension to inside or outside surfaces. 

Material thicker than .078" must have a height at least 2" less than the width.

Minimum flange dimension listed on table.
This includes cutouts close to a bend, notching bend radius an option. 
Machining afterwards cuts into budget.

Hat shaped brackets need 1/2 inch or .3 inch height depending on thickness.

Lots of press brake tooling options.
Cutout library listed online. 
Can use Protocase designer to DL the librarys. 
Many different silf clinching fasteners availble. 

CNC have very large envelopes.
Router has 4X8 table. 

Copper bus bars. 
Tin plating is an option. 

Spot Welding not offered for AL.
 

## Finish options

* Bare
* Grained 
* Tumbled
* Clear chemical coating on AL
* Powdercoating
* Bright electroless tin for copper
* Passivation on Stainless steel
* Anodizing (Type 2) (Non conductive)

* Direct digital
* Silkscreen

## Questions

Graphics will add minimal cost.
Protocase designer has a quote estimate.
Video will be emailed out. 
Can start NOW, the sooner the better.
5052 is standard AL.
